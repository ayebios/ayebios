AyeBIOS a localized BIOS based on Hindawi Programming System. It is 
based on SeaBIOS - an open source implementation of a 16bit X86 BIOS.
AyeBIOS can run in an emulator or it can run natively on X86 hardware
with the use of [coreboot](http://www.coreboot.org/).

SeaBIOS is the default BIOS for [qemu](http://www.qemu.org/) and
[kvm](http://www.linux-kvm.org/). AyeBIOS is a drop-in replacement.

The [coreboot SeaBIOS](http://www.coreboot.org/SeaBIOS) page has
information on using SeaBIOS in coreboot. 

[AyeVGABIOS](AyeVGABIOS) is a sub-project of AyeBIOS. It is derived from 
SeaVGABIOS and extends it with APCISR support.
